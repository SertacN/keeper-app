<h1>Keeper App with Javascript</h2>
<h3>Live Server: https://sertacn.github.io/keeper-app-clone/</h3>
<h3>What is the Keeper App:</h3>
<p>Google Keep Clone. I tried to replicate the Google Keep application exactly.</p>
<p>You can write notes with the Keeper app and even if you close your browser, you can later come back and check them again. You can add and delete notes.</p>

<h3>Functions:</h3>

- The user can create a note by entering the title of the note in the title field and writing the desired content in the content section, and then pressing the 'add' button.

- When the user clicks the add note button, the created note is added to the page.

- The user can delete the added notes as desired and create new notes.

- The added notes are saved in the LocalStorage. This means that even if the page is closed or refreshed, the user's added notes will remain unless they are deleted.

<h3>LocalStorage Usage:</h3>
<p>Every note created by the user is saved in the localStorage with a unique ID. This ensures that the saved notes remain on the page even if the user closes or refreshes it. Pressing the 'Delete' button on the page also deletes the data in the LocalStorage.</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>

<h3>Fonts</h3>
